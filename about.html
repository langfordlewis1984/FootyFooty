      <h3> And there you have it!</h3><h3>A new-fangled, ultimately-fumbled and positively-jumbled little football game!</h3>

        I originally gave myself the following problem domain:</p>
        
        <h4>A simple football game</h4>

          <p>- An entertaining video game that allows you to pass, dribble or shoot and potentially score a goal. Players are confronted with a defender, a team mate, open field or the goal. Their choices result in success or failure.</p>
          
          <p>- I want to offer users to choose their team colours and style the site accordingly. I want to log and store a high score board for user to track progress.</p>
          
          <p>- solution: Offer three options to the user - pass, dribble, shoot - depending on what they see in front of them - defender(s), teammate(s), open field or the goal.</p>
          
          <p>- Allow five runs/attempts and log attempts and successful goals in a scoreboard on a separate Scoreboard page.</p>

          <p>
            After realising that my ambition outweighed my abilities, I decided to adjust my problem domain to give the brief of:</p>

            <h4>A <span> SIMPLER</span> football game</h4>

            <p>
              I had a lot of help, but I got there in the end... ...I think.</p>
