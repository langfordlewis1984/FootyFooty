Final Project for module 201

Nicholas Lewis

A simple football game

An entertaining video game that allows you to pass, dribble or shoot and potentially score a goal. Players are confronted with a defender, a team mate, open field or the goal. Their choices result in success or failure.

I want to offer users to choose their team colours and style the site accordingly. I want to log and store a high score board for user to track progress.

Solution: Offer three options to the user - pass, dribble, shoot - depending on what they see in front of them - defender(s), teammate(s), open field or the goal.

Allow five runs/attempts and log attempts and successful goals in a scoreboard on a separate Scoreboard page.
